<h1>Ace</h1>
<p>In tennis, an ace is a legal serve that is not returned because the server's opponent never touches the ball with their racket, thereby losing the point.</p>

<p>In professional tennis, aces are generally seen on a player's first serve, where the server can strike the ball with maximum force and take more chances with ball placement (usually in the far corners of the service box).</p>

<p>The most common placement of an ace is a hard flat serve to either the middle or the corner of the service box, or a spin serve out wide such as a slice serve to the deuce court for right-handed servers, or a kick serve, also known as a topspin serve, to the ad court for right-handed servers.</p>
