<h1>Tournaments</h1>

<p>Tournaments are often organized by gender and number of players. Common tournament configurations include men's singles, 
women's singles, and doubles (where two players play on each side of the net).  Tournaments may be arranged for specific age groups, 
with upper age limits for youth and lower age limits for senior players. There are also tournaments for players with disabilities, 
such as wheelchair tennis and deaf tennis.
