<h1>Grand Slams</h1>

<p>The French Open (French: Les internationaux de France de Roland-Garros or Tournoi de Roland-Garros, IPA: [ʁɔlɑ̃ ɡaʁɔs]) is a major tennis tournament held over two weeks between late May and early 
June in Paris, France, at the Stade Roland Garros. It is the premier clay court tennis tournament in the world and the second of the four annual Grand Slam tournaments – the other three are the 
<gale:a href="aus_open">Australian Open</gale:a>, <gale:a href="us_open">US Open</gale:a> and <gale:a href="wimbledon">Wimbledon</gale:a>. Roland Garros is the only Grand Slam still held on clay and 
ends the spring clay court season.</p>
<p>It is one of the most prestigious events in tennis, and it has the widest worldwide broadcasting and audience of all regular events in this sport. Because of the slow playing surface and the 
five-set men's singles matches without a tiebreak in the final set, the event is widely considered to be the most physically demanding tennis tournament in the world.</p>
<p>The reigning current champions in singles are Rafael Nadal for the men and Francesca Schiavone for the women at the 2010 French Open.</p></p>
