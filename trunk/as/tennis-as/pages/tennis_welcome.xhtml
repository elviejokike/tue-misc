<p>Tennis is fun and exciting when you have a favorite
player to route for. It keeps one motivated to watch the matches and we
believe it is a fun sport. We believe people play tennis for the love of
the sport. It sure would keep a person in shape and it is one of those
sports where you are on your own, whether you win or lose you are mostly
responsible for the outcome. Of course you have many supporters and fans
and family on your side but only you can get the trophy and check when
you win a tournament.</p>

classical games, tournaments, statistics which is valuable to know when you are
getting into it as a serious supporter.</p>
