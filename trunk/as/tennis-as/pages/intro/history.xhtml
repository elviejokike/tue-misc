<h1>History</h1>

<p>Some people believe that that the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans played 
different versions of tennis. Drawings and descriptions of any tennis-like games have 
not been discovered, but a few Arabic words dating from ancient Egyptian times are cited 
as evidence. The theory goes that the name tennis derives from the Egyptian town of Tinnis 
alongside the Nile and the word racquet evolved from the Arabic word for palm of the hand, 
rahat.
</p>
<p>This history of tennis page gives interesting insight about how tennis evolved 
into the game that we love to play. The sport of tennis has been played for 
hundreds of years, but the game as it is known today is about 130 years old.
