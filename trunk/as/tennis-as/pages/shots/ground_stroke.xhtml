<h1>Groundstroke</h1>

<p>A groundstroke in tennis is a forehand or backhand shot that is executed after the ball bounces once on the court. It is usually hit from the back of the tennis court, around the baseline.</p>

<p>A tennis player whose strategy is to trade groundstrokes with the opponent is termed a baseliner, as opposed to volleyers who prefers to hit volleys near the net.</p>

<p>Very good tennis players can get ground strokes wherever they land. If a good ground stroke is to be played, it would land right at the edge of the tennis court to make it more difficult for the opponent to return the ball.</p>
