<h1>Topspin</h1>
<p>Topspin is a property of a ball that rotates as if rolling in the same direction as it is moving.</p>

<p>In tennis because of a net being in the middle of the court, using topspin will increase the player's consistency. Topspin also allows a player a greater margin of error. Because topspin brings the ball down toward the ground quicker, a player can hit the ball higher over the net, thus increasing the margin of error. Hitting low to high as the player approaches the contact point will impart lift. Keeping the racket face (the strings) slightly closed from perpendicular will impart the topspin to the ball that the player wants.</p>
