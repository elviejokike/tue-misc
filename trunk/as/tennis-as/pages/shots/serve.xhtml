<h1>Serving</h1>
<p>The serve starts a point in tennis, with the ball being hit before it bounces.
The good news is that you get two chances to put the ball in play.</p>

<p>
When serving the first serve, stand behind the baseline between the
center mark and the right sideline. The ball is hit into the diagonal service
box on the other side of the net. When serving, you’re not allowed to step on or over the baseline before
hitting the ball.</p>

<p>
On the first point of a game, the first serve must go over the net and into
the receiver’s right service court. If your first serve doesn’t go into the
correct court, it’s called a Fault. But remember, you get a second chance.
If you miss your second serve, however, your opponent wins that point</p>

<p>If you serve a ball that hits the top of the net before bouncing into the
correct service court, it is called a Let. You may take that serve again. If it
hits the net and then goes outside the correct service court, it’s a fault. A
served ball hitting the post is also a fault.</p>

<p>In traditional tennis, after you have served one game
in a set, you switch ends of the court and now receive your opponent’s
serve for one game. You should switch ends again after the third, fifth,
seventh and following every odd-numbered game.</p>
