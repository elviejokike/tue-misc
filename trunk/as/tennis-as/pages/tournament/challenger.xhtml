<h1>250 and 500 Series</h1>

<p>The ATP Challenger Tour, known until the end of 2008 as the ATP Challenger Series, is a series of international men's professional tennis tournaments. The top 
tier of men's tennis is the ATP World Tour, Challenger Tour events are the second highest level of competition, and the Futures tournaments on the ITF Men's Circuit 
are the third and final tier of international professional competition. The ATP Challenger Tour is administered by the Association of Tennis Professionals. This 
differs from women's tennis, where all the tournaments below WTA Tour level, i.e. the equivalent of both Challengers and Futures, form part of the ITF Women's Circuit 
administered by the International Tennis Federation. Players who succeed on the ATP Challenger Tour earn sufficient ranking points to become eligible for main draw 
or qualifying draw entry at ATP World Tour tournaments.</p>
